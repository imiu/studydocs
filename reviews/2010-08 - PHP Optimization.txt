** Tools **
Siege tool can be used to measure the requests from server
STrace can be used to find out what your process is doing
PECL/Include to generate your include tree
Valgrind for profiling the whole prcess, XDebug for profiling only php code
XHProf by facebook is another profiler, that can output directly to the page (http://github.com/facebook/xhprof)

** Tricks **
1) Enable APC
3-7 times faster
And if you are disciplined enough to deploy only with a reload, then you can switch off the "stack" in APC, so it doesn't check did the file changed or not on every run.

2) Disable .htaccess lookup on every request

3) Disable other index.(html, htm, pl, etc.) files, just index.php in httpd.conf

4) Clear your include path (may be remove '.') and be sure, that it's short and everything is found with one step

5) Clear your require stuff

6) Avoid the conditional includes, if forces APC to reload files

7) Turn off the error_reporting

8) On HipHop always set default timezone right in code
