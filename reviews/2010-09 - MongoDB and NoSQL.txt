The database world is no longer one for all. We have 3 types of DB now:
    RDBMS (Oracle, MySQL)
    New generation OLAP (vertica, aster, greenplum)
    Non-relational operational stores (NoSQL)

NoSQL really means:
    (scalable) non-relational next generation operational datastores and databasees

Scaling out:
    no joins (to make the horizontal scale easy)
        +
    light transactional semantics
        = horizontally scalable architectures
While MySQL is vertical scalable.

Scaling out - CAP
We must pick 2 out of "Consistency", "Availability" and "Partitions tolerance"

AP
    Amazon Dynamo inspired (Voldemort, Cassandra)
CP
    Google BigTable inspired (MongoDB, Hypertable)
    
Data Models
    Important side effect of no joins is
        new data models = improved ways to develop applications

3 main data models
    Key/Value
        memcached, dynamo, voldemort, 
    Column-oriented/tabular
        bigtable, hbase, hypertable
    Document-based
        mongodb, couchdb, JSON stores
** Side note from wiki **
OLTP (online transaction processing) is better with row-oriented RDBMS, while OLAP (online analytical processing) is better with column-oriented DBMS
** End of side note **

We trade features for scalability & performance

MongoDB has it's own query language

MongoDB supports fast updates in place
